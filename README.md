# WhatsApp-Automation
WhatsApp automation using Selenium Python to wish people on their birthdays stored in a MySQL database.

The file is **birthday.py** which automates WhatsApp Web using Selenium Python. Makes use of MySQL to store the events(birthdays/anniversaries).

Requirements:
 * Selenium for Python(pip install selenium)
 * mysql-connector(pip install mysql_connector)
 * chrome driver - can be downloaded from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](here) based on your version of google chrome
 * runs on xampp - automatically opens it. I have configured my *xampp control* in such a way that it opens mysql port - **3306** automatically on start
 * other info in comments of the file.
